SYSOP/SERVER GUIDELINES

1  Terminology

   GAME   = a sanctioned league game
   SYSOP  = gameop, sysop, co-sysop, etc. managing the GAME
   SERVER = TWGS server hosting the GAME
   PLAYER = a single player account registered in the GAME
   LEAGUE = the league governing body

2  Advertizing a GAME

   The GAME shall be advertized in the appropriate public forums at least one week and no more than six weeks in advance of the start time.  Such advertizement shall include the start time and date, the SERVER address, the GAME letter, the TWGS version, and the version number of these rules being enforced.  The GAME shall be subject to the most recent rules as posted by the LEAGUE at the time of the GAME announcement until the GAME completion.  The SYSOP may also include any GAME rules that apply and even strengthen some or all of the LEAGUE player rules.

   The SYSOP shall specify the victory conditions in detail.  Victory conditions shall be objective and not subjective.  Victory may not be shared by more than one team.

3  Hosting a GAME

   The SYSOP may not play a GAME on his/her own SERVER.  The SYSOP may have an observer account for the GAME on his/her SERVER.  The LEAGUE may also request an observer account.  No other person may have an observer account for the GAME.

   The GAME shall start within an hour of the advertized start time.  If the start is delayed more than an hour, the GAME shall be delayed a full 24 hours from the original start time.

   The GAME shall be closed to new PLAYERS after 7 days, i.e. 168 hours after the start time.  The GAME shall remain closed for its duration.  The SYSOP shall submit the team rosters to the LEAGUE within 48 hours of closing the game to new PLAYERS.  The SYSOP shall take measures to ensure that no PLAYER is deleted before he/she submits the team rosters.

   The SYSOP shall take measures to prevent duplicate IPs from participating in the GAME.  PLAYERS suspected of playing duplicate accounts shall have their password changed until the situation can be reviewed.  The SYSOP shall resolve such situations in a timely manner.

   The SYSOP shall take reasonable measures to ensure that the SERVER is available for the duration of the game.  Extended SERVER outages (more than 3 hours) should be announced in public forums if possible.  A GAME re-start after an extended outage should be announced at least 12 hours in advance.  A PLAYER may be disconnected by the SYSOP upon their explicit request.  The SYSOP shall inform the LEAGUE of significant problems with the GAME or with the SERVER.

   The SYSOP may host up to two league games simultaneously on a single SERVER.  Within those restraints, the SYSOP may host as many league games as possible in a year.

4  Completing a GAME

   Upon satisfaction of the victory conditions, the SYSOP shall close the GAME and submit the GAME results and scores to the LEAGUE within 48 hours.  The SYSOP shall be responsible for the accuracy of the game results he/she submits.

5  Discipline

   The SYSOP shall report PLAYER rule violations to the LEAGUE.  PLAYERS may also report GAME irregularities to the LEAGUE.  In order to investigate alleged problems, the LEAGUE shall be given administrative access to the SERVER upon request and in a timely manner.
