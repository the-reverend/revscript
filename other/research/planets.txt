  I. INTRODUCTION

Planets are major assets toward the end of any Trade Wars game.  They
can make or break a player or an entire corporation, and more often 
than not decide who wins and who loses.  It is very difficult to win
a game without owning at least one planet, and some games are played
with planet destruction, capture, or ownership for a certain number
of days the deciding factor.  Where you build or hide your planets,
and how far you advance them in levels, can decide how well you
finish in a game.

In this chapter you will find both general and specific information
on each standard planet type, citadel descriptions and advancement
tables, as well as a few tips and tricks to use planets effectively
and profitably in a game.

In this chapter you will also find the term FOE.  This doesn't refer 
to the enemy, but instead it refers to the trade products produced 
on planets and sold to and bought from ports.  These products are of
course Fuel Ore, Organics, and Equipment.  The first letter of each
product becomes F/O/E, or simply, FOE.


 II. A NOTE ON GAME SERVER MODES:

Trade Wars Game Server (TWGS) can operate in 4 different modes.  There
are differences between how each mode operates, and what is available
for the GameOp to modify.  These 4 modes are identified as:

            Game Mode             identified as being...
     --------------------------   -------------------------
     TWGS (Gold extensions OFF) : version 3.11.xx
     TWGS (Gold extensions  ON) : version 3.11.xx Gold
     MBBS (Gold extensions OFF) : version 3.11.xx MBBS
     MBBS (Gold extensions  ON) : version 3.11.xx MBBS Gold

The TWGS versions are the result of the rewrite by John Pritchett for
playing Trade Wars over the internet.  The 2 versions for MBBS denote
games that are similar to the Major-BBS version that made Trade Wars
so popular.  The Gold extensions allow the GameOp to customize the 
ships, planets, and/or aliens.  The game mode can be identified on the
[V]iew Screen from the Command prompt, and also on the title screen 
when you enter the game.  The most recent release is version 3.11.55
(TWGS10155.EXE) and the date of release is February 14th, 2002.


III. PLANET TYPES & DESCRIPTIONS

There are 7 types of planets when a game universe is created.  Most
of them have a unique characteristic that sets them apart from the
others, making it desirable.  Some have no purpose whatsoever and
are considered a waste of Genesis Torpedoes.  

These descriptions for the planets are taken from the Planetary Specs
database on the Computer menu.  The description for each planet is
listed, but below each description you will also a find helpful chart
for each planet type, showing the production ratios, maximum
population, and maximum capacities for each product.  The daily
production of FOE products is based on a bell curve, so the maximum
production occurs at 50% of the maximum population.  The recommended
levels are also shown below.  Colonists below the 50% mark tend to
multiply and increase, while over the 50% mark tend to die off at a
proportional rate.  Some fluctuation also occurs due to weather
patterns and the severity of the atmosphere.

Fighters cannot be produced directly, meaning you cannot designate any
colonists to produce them.  Fighter production is a percentage of the
total daily production of products, and the formula is shown for each 
planet type.  For example, if you placed 1,500 colonists under Fuel 
Ore on a Class M planet (FOE= 3/7/13, n/10), the colonists would
produce 500 units of fuel and 50 fighters per day.  If you added
another 700 colonists to produce Organics, you would get 500 Fuel,
100 Organics, and 60 fighters per day.

NOTE: The value for fighters under the heading of "2 produce 1" on the
Planet menu shows the number of colonists required to produce one 
fighter with the current population and production levels.  Using the
above example for a Class M planet, with 1,500 colonists under Fuel 
Ore production, the "2 Produce 1" column shows a value of 30.  When 
the 700 colonists are added to produce Organics, the "2 Produce 1"
column shows a value of 36.  This number changes with population and 
production level selections, so it is more of an efficiency value for 
tweaking fighter production.


CLASS (M) EARTH TYPE PLANETS

Thick Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity within 0.7 to 1.3
Earth normal.  Random, but mostly manageable weather patterns, with
temperatures ranging from 0 to 40 degrees Celsius.  Fertile soil,
excellent for Organic production.  Mineral deposits, very good for 
Equipment production.  Chemical elements good for Fuel Ore.  Class M
planets are excellent for human colonization and promote an excellent
population growth curve as well as a very good population harmony
quotient.  They have an above average "habitability band".  Drawbacks
include overpopulation problems, political unrest, and human-induced
destruction of the biosphere.

CLASS (K) DESERT WASTELAND PLANETS

Thin Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity within 0.5 to 1.5
Earth normal.  Weather patterns are mostly dry and hot with temps
ranging from 40 to 140 degrees Celsius.  Little area of fertile soil,
very bad for Organics.  Very little precious metal making it bad for
Equipment production.  Common chemical traces making it great for Fuel
Ore.  Class K worlds are average for humanoid colonization but an arid
and hot climate requires specialized colonists.  Narrow habitability
band but a generally stable political environment as the population 
must depend on each other to survive.  Higher fatality rate than 
Class M worlds.

CLASS (O) OCEANIC PLANETS

Dense Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity within 1.1 to 1.8
Earth normal.  Random and occasional violent weather current patterns,
with temps ranging from 20 to 50 degrees Celsius.  No land mass to 
speak of, making mining for Ore more difficult.  Organics production
quite good (one of the best), but a poor environment for building
Equipment.  Class O planets are more challenging to habitate, but are
almost as safe as class M.  Good population growth curve and decent
population harmony.  Their entire surface is habitable with proper 
gear with the only drawbacks being the costs to settle and build
citadels.

CLASS (L) MOUNTAINOUS PLANETS

Thin Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity between 1.0 to 2.2 
Earth normal.  Weather patterns are wet with temperatures ranging
anywhere from -30 to 50 degrees Celsius depending on the width of the 
habitability band.  Excellent Mineral and Ore deposits but harsh 
conditions only permit avg to below avg Equipment production.  Soil is 
excellent, providing higher than normal organics production.  Colonist
specialization is necessary to maintain population.  Good - very good 
population harmony quotient.  Above average "habitability band" but 
only medium population growth.  Drawbacks include hazards to equipment
and occasional severe weather conditions.

CLASS (C) GLACIAL PLANETS

Extremely thin Oxygen-Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity from 0.5 
to 1.7 Earth normal.  Meteorologically unstable causing violent 
conditions.  Temps range from -10 to -190 degrees Censius.  Full life 
support necessary for colonies and death rates are high.  No workable
soil base so hydroponic Organics are limited.  Modest mineral and 
chemicals exist so production of Ore and Equipment will be below 
average to none.  Class C planets NOT recommended for colonization,
their violent conditions makes it extremely hazardous.  Some class C 
planets have been adopted by the Federation and used as prison 
colonies and used with very effective results.

CLASS (H) VOLCANIC PLANETS

Extremely thin  Oxygen / Nitrogen atmospheres.  Specific gravities are
within 0.8 to 2.6 Earth normal.  Climate patterns are violent with
temperatures from 45 to 400 degrees Celsius.  Full life support 
required for colonization.  Zero workable soil and harsh conditions 
make Organics production impossible.  Good trace elements for equip 
but conditions make production a gamble at best.  Excellent Ore 
production possibilities as material is often ejected by volcanic 
activity and found on the surface.  Very dangerous for colony growth 
as unstable planetary crusts often lead to the complete loss of a 
colony.  The Federation has been known to use Class H planets for 
defense of key sectors due to their large Ore base.

CLASS (U) VAPOROUS/GASEOUS PLANETS

Heavy ranging to very thin atmospheres consisting of various elements,
mostly comprised of helium or of hydrogen.  Specific gravities can 
range from 0.2 to 8.0 of Earth normal.  Climate patterns usually 
extremely violent with temps ranging from -200 to 400 degrees Celsius.
Full life support required at all times.  No production can sustain 
itself on a class U planet.  Some miners have hinted at very valuable 
products that they have extracted from class U worlds but the 
Federation does not have them in its "Official Guide to Mining".  
Class U planets are not recommended for colonization as the 
environment is harsher than being in space itself.

 IV. GOLD EDITION PLANETS

With the creation of the Trade Wars Game Server (TWGS) Gold Edition,
planets can be completely customized.  If the GameOp wants to change
a class (M)Earth Type into class (E)Earth Type, they can do so.  If
they want to add new planets to the list, the can, or they can even
delete planets from the list.  They can even change the colors that
are displayed for a particular type of planet and the violent effects
of weather patterns on colonists.

The game operator (GameOp) can control almost everything about a
planet.  They can change the values for colonists to produce a unit
(Fuel Ore, Organics, or Equipment) or the fighter production.  They
can change the maximum values, and they can modify the amount of
goods needed or time required for each citadel level.

However, there are limits that a GameOp cannot control.  For example,
they cannot change the order that citadels are built.  An interdictor
generator is always level 6, and a Treasury is always Level 1, etc.
They CAN change all the requirements for each level, and they can also
limit how advanced a planet can get.  For example, a GameOp can allow
a class (M)Earth Type planet to advance up to level 4 in a single day,
with only 1 colonist and whatever amounts of FOE are given when the
planet is created, but can also limit the planet to level 4 and not
allow levels 5 and 6.

If nothing else, remember that when Gold extensions are turned on, 
a GameOp can modify the default settings of planets.  The information 
given in the planet tables in section III, Planet Types & Descriptions
as well as section VI, Citadel Advancement Tables are for when Gold
extensions are turned OFF. With Gold extensions turned ON the settings
can be different if the GameOp see fit to change them.  Watch how each
planet you create will progress to know for sure whether it has been
modified or not.


  V. PLANETARY DEFENSES & CITADEL LEVELS

Players can build defenses on a planet to deter or prevent another
player from invading.  These defense levels are referred to as
Citadels and advance from 0 through 6.  Each new level builds upon
the previous one and adds new defensive (or offensive) capability.
These Citadel levels are:

      0- no defenses
      1- Treasury
      2- Combat Control Computer
      3- Quasar cannon
      4- Planetary Thrusters
      5- Planetary Shielding
      6- Interdictor Generator

EXAMPLE: A planet with a level 3 Citadel has a Treasury AND a
         Combat Control Computer AND a Quasar Cannon.

If the GameOp turns ON new player planets, you might start with a new
planet that already has a few colonists on it, along with FOE product.
When you launch a Genesis Torpedo and create a new planet, it will
not have colonists on it and usually no FOE product (the starting 
product is a setting the GameOp can modify, using the Gold edition
extensions, to help you get started).  New planets always start off 
without defenses, though, so they are considered level 0 on the 
citadel scale.  Once you acquire the colonists and products, you can 
start building a level 1 citadel.

LEVEL 1, THE TREASURY

Level 1 citadels have no defenses against invasion, but instead create
a planetary Treasury for you to place credits from trading.  The
2nd Galactic Bank at the Stardock can only hold 500,000 credits.  It
is a nice start, but they also keep the interest.  A planetary
Treasury, however, has a maximum of 999,999,999,999,999 credits, and
you earn 2% interest per day (a small percentage every second) on 
whatever balance you have there.  You can also park your ship in the 
citadel and remain overnight if you so desire, but there is no safety 
there yet.

LEVEL 2, COMBAT CONTROL COMPUTERS

Level 2 citadels add the first defensive ability, the Combat Control
computer, and the first planetary combat variable, the Military
Reaction percentage.  The Combat Control computer gives fighters on a
planet offensive odds of 2:1 or defensive odds of 3:1 against anyone
trying to land and invade or destroy your planet.  The reaction level
determines what percentage of the fighters on the planet are
offensive.  This percentage of fighters react to the invasion by
attacking the invader at 2:1 odds.  The fighters left behind on the
planet defend it using the better 3:1 odds.  An invader must survive
the offensive wave of fighters, and destroy all the defensive
fighters, before they can land.

LEVEL 3, QUASAR CANNONS

Level 3 citadels have the dreaded Quasar cannon, one of the nastiest
weapons in the game.  Powered by Fuel Ore on the planet, this weapon
can fire at opponents that enter the sector, or fire a more damaging
blast at anyone trying to enter the atmosphere and land.  The values 
represented by the atmospheric cannon setting are different between 
the TWGS games and MBBS games.  This causes a great deal of confusion 
by their similarity and simple appearance.  Both formulas take into 
account the designated percentage of fuel, but they use the percentage
differently.  Sector shots will do 1/3 of a point of damage for each 
unit of fuel used, while atmospheric shots will do 2 points of damage
for each unit of fuel used.

NOTE! Watch the differences between the percentage settings, the 
damage done, and the fuel used in the following examples.  The
settings for Sector fire have the same effect in both TWGS mode and
MBBS mode, but the Atmospheric cannon fire is different under the
TWGS mode.

SECTOR EXAMPLE: A planet has 10,000 units of Fuel Ore and a quasar
cannon setting of 10% for sector fire.  When an invader enters the
sector, the cannon will use 1,000 units of fuel and blast the ship
for 333 points of damage.  This leaves 9,000 units of fuel, so a 2nd 
sector shot would use 900 units fuel and do 300 points damage.

ATMOSPHERIC (MBBS) EXAMPLE: After the planet above fired once in the
sector shot, there was 9,000 units of fuel remaining on the planet.
If an invader tried to land on the planet with the atmospheric set
to 10%, the cannon will use 900 units fuel and do 1,800 points damage.

ATMOSPHERIC (TWGS) EXAMPLE: After the planet above fired once in the
sector shot, there was 9,000 units of fuel remaining on the planet.
If an invader tried to land on the planet with the atmospheric set
to 10%, the cannon will do 900 points damage and use 450 units fuel.

DISCUSSION NOTE:  When Trade Wars Game Server was first released, the
atmospheric setting was a hotly-debated issue.  After many emails and
notes passed through discussion groups, it was decided to keep this
difference to keep the TWGS version true to the original Trade Wars.
When someone invades a sector, they usually come armed with a planet
scanner and scan the planets below before landing.  The Qcannon
atmospheric setting is revealed to a planet scanner.  Instead of
removing this feature, the atmospheric cannon setting can be set
to twice the sector fire to equal the same effect.  With the revealed
setting doubled, an invader might think twice about landing.


LEVEL 4, PLANETARY THRUSTERS

Level 4 citadels add planetary thrusters.  These are very similar
to transwarp drives for ships, allowing you to literaly drive your
planet around the universe.  However, each target sector must have a
fighter in it to lock onto, and the planet uses 400 units of Fuel Ore
for each sector you jump, so you might not want to move it very often.
Also, you cannot "blind warp" a planet like you can with a ship.

LEVEL 5, PLANETARY SHIELDING SYSTEM

Level 5 citadels add a planetary shielding system.  When traders
holoscan the sector, the appearance of the planet looks very
different, as it is surrounded by arrows and says that the planet is
shielded, even if you have not added them yet.  Because planets are
so much larger than ships, it takes 10 ship shields to make one
planetary shield.  If you placed 1,000 ship shields into the shield
generator, they become 100 planetary shields.  The reverse is also
correct, that removing shields from the shield generator can only be
done in units of 10.

An invader must defeat planetary shields at 10:1 odds against him
(like the original 1:1 ship shields).  Another advantage is that
200 planetary shields will protect your Quasar Cannon from being
dampened by a photon missle attack, and will also save your ship
from getting damaged (i.e. you losing your turns) if you happen to be
on the planet.

LEVEL 6, INTERDICTOR GENERATORS

Level 6 citadels save the best for last, the Planetary Interdictor
Generator.  This device prevents a trader from moving or warping out
of the sector, at a cost of 500 Fuel Ore per attempt.  Once the planet
is drained of fuel, the interdiction fails and the trader gets free, 
but each failed attempt gives the Quasar Cannon another opportunity to
blast the invader with a sector shot.


 VI. THE PLANETARY TRANSPORTER

Once you have built a citadel on a planet, you can enter the citadel 
and order a Planetary Transporter system.  These very useful devices 
will normally cost 50,000 credits for the first hop and an another
25,000 credits for each additional hop.  The credits are taken from 
you, not your planetary Treasury.

Similar to the transporter pads aboard ships, these will transport you
AND YOUR SHIP to any sector within range that you have a fighter to 
lock on to.  The transporter will power itself by using Fuel Ore from 
the planet at a rate of 10 units of fuel for each sector in the jump, 
but you are only charged 1 turn for its use.


VII. CITADEL ADVANCEMENT TABLES

The tables below show the total product from each catagory necessary
to build citadels through Level 6, and the breakdown for each level.
Again, these tables are for Gold extensions turned OFF, or for when
Gold extensions are ON and the GamOp did not modify them.

VIII. TIPS, TRICKS, AND CASHING IN ON PLANETS

Time to reveal a few secrets that veteran players know and use to
their advantage.  Hopefully there is some information in this section
for all players to pick up on and learn, new and old alike.

WHERE TO BUILD - TUNNELS AND BUBBLES

Several salty, space-faring veterans of the game use these labels
interchangeably, but there is a technical difference between them.

A bubble is a large section of space with limited ways in and out,
a minimum of 100 sectors in size.  The maximum size depends on the
size of the universe being created and the number of bubbles desired
by the game operator.  When Gold extensions are turned ON, a flag is
removed, and the option to create bubbles in enabled.  The GameOp can
then break up the universe from one large area into several smaller
ones.  These smaller areas are called bubbles.

Tunnels are much smaller, and are created in every version of the
game.  Tunnels range in size from a single dead-end sector to as
large as 20 or more sectors.  They can have a single sector as an
entrance/exit point (called the mouth, the gate, or the front door
sector), or may have one or more one-way exits that let you leave but
not return.  These one-ways are often called "back doors", but the
point is that no one can get INTO a tunnel except through the
"front door".

Before you start building, mark the entrance to a tunnel as an "avoid"
sector on the Computer menu, then try to plot a course into the tunnel
from the outside.  If the computer finds another way in, then it is
not a safe tunnel to build in.  If the computer cannot find another
route, then the tunnel is "verified" and is likely safe to start
creating planets and colonizing.

Even tunnels that have been verified can be flawed, but not often.
In very large games where the maximum course length is short, it is
possible for the computer to not find another way into a tunnel when
one actually does exist (also clear any avoids you may have to prevent
blocking another route). Few and far between, but such games can be
created.  If you suspect this might be the case, try verifying the
tunnel from different points around the universe, just to be sure.
Just use the Computer menu option [F]ind Route to save turns moving.


COLONIZING TRICKS

Once you find a nice, quiet tunnel several sectors away from FedSpace
(you don't want to be found that quickly, do you?), you can start
making planets and colonizing them.  Having to move to Terra and back
quickly uses up your daily allotment of turns.  A ship capable of
TransWarp can really help here.  Buy fuel from a port and leave it on
the planet you want to colonize, then TransWarp to Terra, grab your
share of colonists, and TransWarp back.

Simple, right?  Sure, if you already have an Imperial StarShip or a
Corporate Flagship, and trying this in a Havoc Gunstar uses more fuel
than it's worth.  Here is where a Planetary Transporter can really
pay off.  Use the old-fashioned move technique to grab enough of the
colonists to start making a Level 1 citadel.  Once it is started,
start dropping more fuel on the planet.  Once the citadel becomes a
level 1 you can buy a transporter pad and upgrade it enough to reach
Terra.  Grab enough fuel for the return trip, beam yourself to Terra
and grab colonists, then TransWarp back.  Complicated, but remember
that beaming you and your ship with a planetary transporter only
uses a single turn, but 10 units of fuel from the planet per hop.

Red (evil) players cannot lock onto Terra directly, but they can try
leaving a fighter close by and warp to the fighter, then move the
rest of the way to Terra and TransWarp back.  If you don't have the
luxury of a TransWarp drive, a planetary transporter still saves you
the cost of moving to Terra, cutting your turns used per cycle in
half and doubling the productivity of colonizing.

PLANET FARMING FOR CASH

Planets worth keeping early in the game are class (O) Oceanic planets
and class (L) Mountainous planets.  Class (H) Volcanic planets are the
best for making fuel, but are very slow in building citadels (2-1/2
weeks for that Quasar cannon, and over 7 weeks to reach level 6).
With 1 million units of fuel to run a Quasar cannon, they are the best
planets in the long run for tunnel defense, but slow in getting there.
After the first week, consider starting these after tunnel defenses
are built up enough to defend yourself.  In an invasion, volcanics
make a wonderful prizes.

But for making money, Class (O) planets are champions.  They ramp up
very close to what a port can handle buying in a single day.  An
Oceanic planet reaches peak production at 100,000 colonists and can
produce 50,000 units of Organics a day.  At maximum, a port can only
take in 65,535 units a day for about 2.2 - 2.5 million credits profit.
In some games, the ports are limited to 32,000 units and offer you
around 0.6 - 1.2 million in profit.  Oceanics can outpace the ports!

Like colonist production, the value of products at the ports are
based on a bell curve.  You get a better offer from a port at 90% than
you will from a port at 10%.  Once you upgrade the port to its maximum
volume, only sell products to reach the 50% mark, and do this twice a
day, or the top 25% four times a day, to maximize your profits.

Making class M planets and farming equipment from them sounds like a
good idea at the start of the game, but it isn't.  While equipment is
more valuable than organics, at best they can make 1,153 units per day
you can sell for about 100,000-150,000 credits.

PLANET FARMING FOR FIGHTERS

Mountainous planets reach citadel level 1 in only 2 days, and level 2
after another 5 days, giving it the first defense with a Combat
Control computer AND the first Quasar cannon in 12 days.  Another
advantage is the n/12 fighter production with a fuel ratio of 2.
This means that placing colonists in fuel production makes really
good fuel, and 24 colonists to produce 1 fighter.  It's the best place
for the first 20,000 colonists to go, making 1,666 fighters per day
and 10,000 units of fuel.

But do not discount those Oceanic planets!  What Mountainous planets
make in speed, Oceanics can beat with volume!  Class (L)s might have
the advantage with fighter production of n/12, but they top out at
only 20,000 colonists.  Class (O) planets are five times that, and
with production only 3 points different at n/15 can make more than
triple the fighters per day at top production.


  IV. INVADING SECTOR & PLANETARY DEFENSES

Invading another person or corporation's tunnel is a dangerous matter
to deal with, as the costs are often high.  You have to weigh the
advantages against the disadvantages, the prize versus the cost,
well before you reach a decision.  Maybe its to gain their colonists,
maybe its a deterrent to keep them from advancing while you build up
your own forces and sectors.  Whether you are defending a sector or
invading one, you have to understand the order of events during an
invasion.

ORDER OF EVENTS

Let's assume a worst-case scenario: a Level 6 planet, with some
fighters and a Military Reaction percentage set, fuel ore for the 
Quasar Cannon, some planetary shielding in place, and Interdictor
Generator is active.  The sector has fighters, Armid mines, Limpet
mines, and some NavHaz (from previous attempt)s. Here's what happens,
one event at a time, until you are destroyed or victorious:

   SECTOR EVENTS
      1- NavHaz might be hit.
      2- A Limpet mine would attach to your ship.
      3- Armid mines will detonate.
      4- Quasar cannon will fire at Sector level
         (multiple planets with Quasars fire in planet# order).
      5- Sector fighters (1:1 odds) attack (if set to Offensive) or
         challenge (if set to Defensive ot Toll).
   ATMOSPHERIC EVENTS
      6- Quasar cannon fires at Atmospheric setting.
      7- Planetary Shielding must be defeated at 10:1 odds.
         (after shields are defeated Quasar gets another Atmos shot)
      8- Military reaction fighters attack at 2:1 odds.
      9- remaining fighters defend the planet at 3:1 odds.
     10- You land on the planet.

If you are still alive after the Sector events, remember that the
Interdictor Generator will not let your ship leave.  You can, however,
use your transporter pad to get into another ship if one is in range.
If you attempt to back out of the sector or TransWarp out, the
Interdictor will use 500 fuel ore preventing you from leaving, and
the Quasar will fire again at the Sector level.  If there is less
than 500 fuel on the planet the interdiction fails and you escape.

THE PHOTON ADVANTAGE

If Photon Missiles are allowed and you are quick enough, several of
the steps above can be skipped.  Below a level 5 citadel, or less
than 200 planetary shields are in the shield generator, then:
      3- Armid mines WILL NOT detonate.
      4- Quasar cannons are dampened and WILL NOT fire Sector shots.
      5- Sector fighters WILL NOT attack or challenge.
      6- Dampened Quasar cannon WILL NOT fire at Atmospheric setting
      8- Military reaction fighters WILL NOT attack
      9- ramaining fighters WILL NOT defend.
The defenses that are not skipped and must still be dealt with are-
      1- NavHaz might be hit.
      2- A Limpet mine would attach to your ship.
      7- Planetary shielding (if any) must be defeated.
     10- You land on the planet

If the planet has a level 5 citadel and 200 or more shields, then:
      3- Armid mines WILL NOT detonate.
      5- Sector fighters WILL NOT attack or challenge.

An invader still has to deal with all the planet-bound defenses.
When the photon wave expires, so do the advantages.  

BIG MOTHS, LITTLE MOTHS, FULL-SCALE WAR

Fuel Ore and fighters are the commodities of war, whoever has the
most wins the battle.  War-by-fighters goes to whomever has the most
on hand and better odds, so its Offensive in nature.  War-by-Ore is
a matter of surviving the Quasar cannon blasts, so its more Defensive
in nature.

Entering a sector with a Quasar cannon for the purpose of draining
the planet's fuel is called mothing.  Because Sector shots use up
fuel ore on the planet, and do little damage for the volume, some
invaders will chew up defenses before launching their main assault.

Big moths are strongly-defensive ships.  They have lots of shields
and fighters to kill before the ship is destroyed.  This eats up more
sector fighters and fuel ore from cannon blasts.  If the sector
fighters are defeated, but the planets are still strong enough, an
invader can move out and back again, taking Sector blasts from the
Q-cannons and depleting the Fuel Ore.  If a level 6 citadel is
present, this goes even faster by using up the added 500 units from
interdiction.

Little moths are the opposite of big moths.  These are small, cheap,
and disposable.  Use big moths for lesser defenses they can survive,
and little moths for extremely strong defenses.  Why get into a big
War-by-fighter battle with a Quasar cannon?  It fires based on the
fuel available, not the size of your ship.  You can get podded twice
per day and survive, but the third podding will destroy your ship
and leave you out for the rest of the day.  Several corporation
members (other corps can join in, too!) can really drain fuel
reserves in this manner.

Full-scale war is just what it says.  Fighters get shredded, fuel
gets burned, and Quasar cannons get red hot from use.  Just when the
tide turns, the Grimy Trader shows up and starts charging admission
(just kidding)!  Everything comes into play in a big way, and win the
day or flee in frustration, someone will win the battle.  Just try
to remember its a game, a game of Trading and War, Warring and
Trading,  a game called "Trade Wars 2002".

The Quasar Cannon on Ferrengal locks onto you and fires!
Your ship is destroyed.

Have a nice day!
