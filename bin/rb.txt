welcome to rev-builder, the reverend's premier rexx script building utility.

USAGE:  RB scriptname libraryfolder authorname

the rev-builder will search the libraryfolder for all subroutines used in the
script and if found, include them in the script - it also searches each library
file for more subroutines to include.  if licence.txt is found in the
libraryfolder, then a license will be included in the script.  a script can be
re-build any number of times and it will always only include the the subroutines
needed by your script.  underscores in the authorname will be converted to
spaces.  if you have spaces in your scriptname or library folder, enclose the
parameter in quotes like this:  RB "my script.zrx" "my library\" my_name

there are a few format requirements:

  1) a script should begin with /* REXX */ in order to get full header
     information.
  2) all libraries should have the .zrl extension.
  3) double and triple star comments are special comments used by the
     rev-builder.  do not use /** and /*** style comments in your script, except
     as illustrated below.
  4) the first line of each library should begin with a double-star comment
     (/** ).
  5) do not edit a script below the triple-star comment. when re-building a
     script (building a script that has already been built before), everything
     below the /*** comment will be thrown away and replaced by the most recent
     library routines.  make sure you fix bugs in your libraries instead of
     fixing them below the /*** comment.
  6) star-dash comments (/*- ) will always be removed from a script and its
     libraries by the rev-builder.

EXAMPLE:  RB _example.zrx library\ the_reverend

in this example, the _example.zrx script will be built using the subroutine
libraries found in the library\ folder.  notice how the original script has a
star-dash comment, but the built version does not.  also, the original script
only calls one subroutine, _ansi, but the built version contains _dwords and
_dword, which are used by the _ansi library.

BEFORE:

     /* REXX */
     
     /*- star-dash comment -*/
     
     line="hello there"
     
     call zocwrite _ansi("bt;frd")
     call zocwriteln line
     
     exit
