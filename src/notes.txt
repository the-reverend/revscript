Our Father, who 0wnz heaven, j00 r0ck! May all 0ur base someday be belong to you! May j00 0wn earth just like j00 0wn heaven. Give us this day our warez, mp3z, and pr0n through a phat pipe. And cut us some slack when we act like n00b lamerz, just as we teach n00bz when they act lame on us. Please don't give us root access on some poor d00d'z box when we're too pissed off to think about what's right and wrong, and if you could keep the f3i off our backs, we'd appreciate it. For j00 0wn r00t on all our b0x3n 4ever and ever, 4m3n.

[08:36] Dr. Bad: its about the one way we'll win this- assuming we got about 7 moths worth of fuel left, but the enemies only have 24 slots with no citadels
[08:36] Dr. Bad: I do:  

call zocsend "UYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYNUYN" 

call zocsend ".^MZC^M"
[08:37] Dr. Bad: and repeat it 4 times before putting a wait in
[08:37] the reverend: ah ok i was gonna add .^Mcqzn
[08:38] Dr. Bad: doesn't really matter what so long as it loops- main thing is to have a whole lot of UYN's before the naming bit so you spend most of the running time processing UYN
[08:38] the reverend: well mines gonna basically do that from remote mode - will run until it sees a 'stop ::
[08:39] the reverend: send
 'plock ::
 'stop ::

[script ideas]
-- pmaint script
   Founder: If you can with that planet-maint script develop a routing for 
   stripping planets into it.. =)  Want to be able to strip an opponents 
   sector of colo's and product and warp it back to my sector (assuming 
   don't have level 4's at the time) with the option of choosing to pick up 
   ore in their sector or from my sector to get back and forth with it.
-- buydown-distant, productmover-distant
-- autofurber (Colin Stagner) - respond to subspace, get name, ta, warp to dock, buy, tow to ta, get fuel, etc.
-- attack script
-- cap script
